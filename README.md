# Foreword

The Rttf2pt1 R package was created and maintained by [Winston Chang](https://github.com/wch) on [github](https://github.com/wch/Rttf2pt1) for more than 13 years with a first commit on github the 11th of june 2012.
The previous commit history of the package can be found [here](https://github.com/wch/Rttf2pt1).
The responsibilities and attention of Winston Chang are on things quite far away from extrafont and Rttf2pt1 these days. 
As a consequence he asked for another person to maintain the Rttf2pt1 package and I ([Frederic Bertrand](https://github.com/fbertran)) volunteered [(read here)](https://github.com/wch/Rttf2pt1/issues/25#issuecomment-3320579566).

The following text is an update the original [README.md](https://github.com/wch/Rttf2pt1/blob/main/README.md) from Winston Chang repository on [github](https://github.com/wch/Rttf2pt1).
