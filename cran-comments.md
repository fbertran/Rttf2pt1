## Maintainer change

The Rttf2pt1 R package was created and maintained by [Winston Chang](https://github.com/wch) on [github](https://github.com/wch/Rttf2pt1) for more than 13 years with a first commit on github the 11th of june 2012.
The previous commit history of the package can be found [here](https://github.com/wch/Rttf2pt1/commits/master/).
The responsibilities and attention of Winston Chang are on things quite far away from extrafont and Rttf2pt1 these days. 
As a consequence, he asked for another person to maintain the Rttf2pt1 package.
The package was removed from CRAN and [I](https://github.com/fbertran) volunteered [(read here)](https://github.com/wch/Rttf2pt1/issues/25#issuecomment-3320579566) to maintain the package and have it back on CRAN.

Best regards,
